Ugly numbers are numbers whose only prime factors are 2, 3 or 5. The sequence 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12, 15, ... shows the first 11 ugly numbers. By convention, 1 is included. The numbers 7, 11, 13 are not ugly because they are prime. The number 14 is not ugly because in its prime factor the 7 will come. Write a program to find and print the Nâ€™th ugly number.
